## ~~Dear Diary~~
# First of all, let me get something straight: This is a README, not a diary

        This is my first ever personal portfolio! (Mostly because I get halfway through making one before I start hating it.)

  How I see it, you can do anything with a website—make it super simple and get the content right in front of people's faces, or go all out with animations and design with a crazy   polish. But I decided to do NEITHER and now here we are. The theming is a full investigation case on myself with the crime here being that this website is absolutely buns when resizing.

        While making this website though.... something was off... almost like the code kept changing itself into these weird cryptic messages. Ever since I made this repo, files have been going missing left and right. I even began to see random comments and console logs appear. I deleted as many as I could to the best of my ability and hopefully thats the end of that.
